# Installation

### 1. Easy Mode

Install via HACS.

### 2. Manual

Install it as any custom homeassistant component:

1. Download `custom_components` folder.
2. Copy the `xlights_schedule` directory to the `custom_components` directory of your homeassistant installation. Your `custom_components` directory resides within your homeassistant configuration directory.

**Note**: If the `custom_components` directory does not exist, you need to create it.

After a correct installation, your configuration directory should look like the following:

    
    └── ...
    └── configuration.yaml
    └── custom_components
        └── xlights_schedule
            └── __init__.py
            └── media_player.py
            └── manifest.json
    

# Configuration

1. Enable the component by editing your configuration.yaml file (within the config directory as well). Edit it by adding the following lines:
    ```
    # Example configuration.yaml entry
    media_player:
      - platform: xlights_schedule
        name: NAME
        host: IP_ADDRESS:PORT (or hostname:port)

2. Reboot Home Assistant
3. You're good to go!
